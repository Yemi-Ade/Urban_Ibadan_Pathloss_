# Urban_Ibadan_Pathloss_
Field data were collected using the G-Net Track Pro software installed on a smartphone mounted in a vehicle.
The study focused on Agodi GRA in Ibadan, a densely built urban area with diverse urban conditions. 
The drive-test was conducted along three routes to measure key network parameters, including Reference 
Signal Received Power (RSRP) at different distances from the base station. These routes were carefully selected 
to cover a range of environmental conditions and obstacles that could affect signal propagation, ensuring a 
comprehensive assessment of path loss behavior in urban Ibadan. The vehicle traveled at a 30 km/h speed to maintain 
measurement accuracy across the routes. Each route spanned 800 meters, with signal measurements taken at 50-meter 
intervals. Data were gathered at a transmission frequency of 2.6 GHz from the LTE base transceiver station (BTS). 
The site is optimally positioned within the desired coverage area and experiences minimal interference from nearby 
transmitters, which enhances measurement accuracy. The data was collected under partly cloudy weather conditions for the routes shown in Figure 1.
